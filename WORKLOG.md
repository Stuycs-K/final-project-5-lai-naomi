### 5/29

1. finished dragging-- the boats can be dragged around the board
2. added boundaries for the boats-- the boats cannot be dragged outside of the window/board

### 5/30

1. added rotation-- by pressing r, the ship rotates (vertical vs. horizontal)
2. setup phase-- the ships can only be dragged during setup. if the spacebar is pressed, the ships are locked in place
3. ships move along a grid-- when dragged, the ships lock into the grid

### 5/31
1. fixed rotation-- when the ships are rotated, they are anchored to one grid spot (the rotation is more predictable)
2. worked on pin location-- when setup is finished, the ships store info about their location
3. adjust ship and grid alignment
